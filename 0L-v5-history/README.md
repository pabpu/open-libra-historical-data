# 0L v5 snapshots

The open libra blockchain v5 has been on-line between end of october 2021 and end of november 2023. During this time, 692 'epochs' were completed. Usually an epoch lasts 24h, some exceptions occured during planned or unplanned networks halts.

Purpose of this repository is to add some transparency about accounts and balances during this time based on the snapshots taken each epoch.
